# Day 35 Task | Cohort 2.0

This file contains all the **JavaScript exercises and experiments** I completed as part of **Day 33** in **Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0**.  
It focuses on **loops** and **conditional statements**, practiced through simple programs and logical exercises directly in the browser console.

📌 **About the Day 33 Task**  
Day 33 was focused on **JavaScript loops and conditionals** — understanding how to repeat actions using different loop types and how to make decisions in code using conditional statements.  
The goal was to get comfortable with **loop control flow**, **user input validation**, and **decision-making logic** in JavaScript.

✨ **Task Description**

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **For Loop** | Practiced looping structures to print sequences, numbers, and patterns. |
| **While / Do...While Loops** | Explored different loop types and their use cases. |
| **Conditional Statements** | Implemented decision-making using **if**, **else if**, **else**, **ternary**, and **switch**. |
| **User Input Validation** | Used **prompt()**, **Number()**, and **isNaN()** to handle and validate user inputs. |
| **Practical Examples** | Created small exercises like voting eligibility, password validation, and multiplication tables. |
| **Loop Logic** | Used counters, conditions, and iterations to solve simple numerical problems. |

🛠️ **Technologies Used**  
- **JavaScript** – Core syntax, loops, conditionals, and user input handling  
- **Browser Console** – For running and testing the code outputs  
- **HTML (optional)** – Used to embed and test scripts interactively  

## 🧩 Practice Questions

### Level 1 – Pure Beginner Practice

1. **Print numbers from 1 to 10**  
   Uses a simple `for` loop to print numbers sequentially.

2. **Print only even numbers from 1 to 20**  
   Checks for even numbers using the modulus operator `%`.

3. **Print numbers from 10 to 1**  
   Demonstrates decrementing loops.

4. **Print the word "yes" 5 times**  
   Simple repetition using a `for` loop.

5. **Check numbers from 1 to 20 if they are odd or even**  
   Uses conditionals with string interpolation for clear output.

6. **Ask the user for a number and check if it’s positive or negative**  
   Handles both positive and negative input values.

7. **Ask user’s age and check voting eligibility**  
   Includes input validation for empty or non-numeric values.

8. **Print the multiplication table of 5**  
   Prints the table up to 10 using a loop.

9. **Count how many numbers between 1 and 15 are greater than 8**  
   Demonstrates use of counters and conditional checking inside a loop.

10. **Ask user for password and print access status**  
    Compares user input with a stored password, includes empty and cancel checks.


📖 **Learning Outcome**  
Through this task, I learned how to:  
- Use **for**, **while**, **do...while**, **forEach**, **for...in**, and **for...of** loops  
- Implement **conditional statements** using **if-else**, **ternary**, and **switch**  
- Validate user input using **trim()**, **isNaN()**, and **Number()**  
- Understand **loop counters**, **increment/decrement operations**, and **nested logic**  
- Apply loops in real-world logic (e.g., counting, tables, validation checks)  
- Practice clean and readable JavaScript structure  

🌟 **Acknowledgement**  
This task was completed as part of **Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0** under the guidance of **Harsh Bhaiya**.  

It helped me strengthen my understanding of **looping structures**, **conditional logic**, and **input handling** in JavaScript through practical exercises.
